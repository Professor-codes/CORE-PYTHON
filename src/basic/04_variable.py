# in python a variable is a named location in memory that is used to store data.
# python doesn't require you to declare the datatype of a variable when you create it.
# python is dynamically typed.

x = 10  # Integer
name = "Sahil"  # String
pi = 3.14159  # Float
is_valid = True  # Boolean

# variable's type can change during execution
x = 10  # x is an integer
x = "Hello"  # Now x is a string

#  assign values to multiple variables in a single line
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3  # a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
x = y = z = 0  # All variables are set to 0

# python doesnâ€™t have a built-in constant type
# variables that should not change are written in uppercase
PI = 3.14159
