# MODULE
# in python, a module is a file
# containing python code (functions, classes, or variables)
# that can be imported and reused in other programs.

# module is like a code library
# written by somebody else.

# two types of modules in python:
# built in modules - these modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
# external modules - these modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.

# PIP
# pip stands for "Pip Installs Packages"
# and is the default package manager for Python.
# it allows you to install, upgrade, and manage
# third-party python libraries from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other repositories.

# import pandas  # This is an example of external module
# import hashlib  # This is an example of builtin module
# pandas.read_csv("one.csv")
# m = hashlib.sha256()
